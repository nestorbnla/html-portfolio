<h1>Good Movies to Watch</h1>
<h2>Top 3 must watch movies according to Nestor</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Personally, the best film Leo has starred in. A true star studded cast which features, then, up and coming actor Cillian Murphy, also the likes of Tom Hardy. The movie will have you constantly on your toes with a story line that is easy to follow along, but also likeley to cause you to lose yout grasp on reality!</p>

<h3>Good Dinosaur</h3>
<p>I know, I know. A kid movie. However, this is a movie that will keep you entertained through the whole watch. Comedy, Love, Heartbreak, it truly has it all. I have never not cried watching this movie</p>

<h3>The Phantom of the Opera</h3>
<p>Yes, of course you can watch the play. But this one lead by Gerard Butler, whom, to my surprise has fantastic pipes. Also, co starring is Emmy Rossum from hit show Shameless. Two beautiful voices come together to make a timeless movie!</p>
